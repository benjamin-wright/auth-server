# Auth Server

A hobby auth service that's easy to set up and tear down on a whim

# TODO

- Support (require) TLS
- Swap out verify component for JWT jwks implementation
- Allow the CSS and icon to be overriden at deploy-time
- Add network policies to isolate the auth services from the rest of the cluster
